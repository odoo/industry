            Welcome to the <strong><font style="color: rgb(113, 75, 103);">Odoo Bike Shop package</font></strong>!
        </p>
        <p>
            This module offers all the essential tools a bike shop needs to run daily operations in one place. It covers everything from selling bikes; both online through an eCommerce website and in-store with a point of sale system, to managing
            repairs, maintenance services, and inventory.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bike Shops can handle customer orders, schedule test rides, receive and track service requests, and follow up on repairs. Inventory and parts can be monitored and reordered when needed. And all customer communication and invoicing are
            handled directly within the system, keeping everything organized and connected. 
        </p>
        <p>It’s a simple way to keep sales, services, and stock under control while offering a smooth experience to clients.</p>

                </ol>

            <li>

                    customer collects their bike.

        <h3><strong>Repair and Maintenance Workflow</strong><br /></h3>
        <hr />
        <p>Handle all repair and maintenance operations efficiently with the <strong>Field Service</strong> app.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open the<strong> Field Service app</strong> and check your assigned tasks or priorities.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Select a task to begin the repair. Log each product used (e.g., brake pads, chains) directly on the task. These will be automatically added to the related Sales Order and invoiced later.</p></li>
            <li>
                <p>For specific repairs, track the time spent on the task using the <strong>Timesheet</strong> feature, allowing accurate billing based on time spent.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Mark the task as <strong>Done</strong> when completed. Once all tasks linked to the Sales Order are in this stage, a <strong>notification email</strong> will automatically be sent to the customer confirming that their bike
                    is ready.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Complete the<strong> </strong>repair and maintenance worksheet using a <strong>Worksheet Template</strong> (e.g., checklist of performed operations, technician name, signature field,...). The client can sign it upon collection.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    When the customer returns to pick up the bike, open the <strong>Point of Sale (PoS) app</strong>, load the related Sales Order (quotation), and proceed with the payment. Odoo allows retrieving existing quotations in the PoS for
                    seamless final payment processing.

                <p>
                    <strong>Customize your project stages</strong> in the “Workshop” project: add columns like “Waiting for Parts” to better track blocked repairs waiting for a parts delivery, or “Ready for Pick-Up" when the repair is done. 
                </p>
                <p>Use the <strong>Survey app</strong> to send a satisfaction survey after the repair is completed and the bike is returned.</p>

        <h4><strong>Automated Reordering</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to the <strong>Inventory app </strong>and open the product (e.g., brake pads).<strong> </strong>Use the <strong>Smart Buttons </strong>on the product page to access the <strong>Reordering Rules.</strong></li>
            <li>Set<strong> the minimum and maximum stock levels. </strong>Define the quantities that will trigger automatic restocking (e.g., Min: 10, Max: 50).</li>
