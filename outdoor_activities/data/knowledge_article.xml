        <h3>From Opportunity to Invoice</h3>
        <p>
            Since you are using the integrated website, your contact form is configured to automatically create an opportunity. <br />
            A customer has filled it in and is inquiring about the possibility of a Family Dive - how exciting! This section will take you through all the steps to turn this request into a sale.<br />
            First we open the <strong>CRM</strong>-App. There we see the new request in the stage New.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="/web/image/outdoor_activities.ir_attachment_1421" alt="" class="img img-fluid o_we_custom_image" />
        </p>
        <p>
            By clicking on this opportunity we open the corresponding opportunity. Once there, We can send a message via the button "<strong>Send Message</strong>" on top of the chatter to further qualify the request. Once we know
            everything we need, we can create a quotation by clicking on the smart button "<strong>New Quotation</strong>" on the top left.
        </p>
        <div class="o_editor_banner user-select-none o_not_editable lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-warning pb-0 pt-3">
            <i class="o_editor_banner_icon mb-3 fst-normal">‚ö†Ô∏è</i>
            <div class="w-100 px-3 o_editable">
                <p><strong> Important</strong></p>
                <p>The Customer field is <strong>not</strong> required on the opportunity form.</p>
                <p>
                    However, customer information must be added or linked before a quotation can be sent. If the Customer field is left blank on the opportunity, clicking the New Quotation button opens a pop-up window
                    with the following options:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Create a new customer: creates a new customer record, using any available information provided on the opportunity form.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Link to an existing customer: opens a drop-down field with existing customer names. Select a name to link this new quotation to an existing customer record.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Do not link to a customer: the quotation will <strong>not</strong> be linked to a customer, and no changes are made to the customer information.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            <img src="/web/image/outdoor_activities.ir_attachment_1422" alt="" class="img img-fluid o_we_custom_image img-thumbnail" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Perfect, the customer has confirmed the quotation and we can send the Sales Order - congratulations on selling a private tour! For more details on creating and sending quotations from the CRM-App, please see our official
            documentation on the subject.

        </p>
        <p>
            The final step in this flow is for us to reserve the relevant resource to ensure we don't get double booked - in the case our diving expedition it is our boat.<br />
            To do so, we go to the <strong>Appointments-App</strong>, select <strong>Schedule </strong>and<strong> Resources Bookings. </strong>Then we click on the agreed upon date and fill the necessary information in the form
            <strong>.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="/web/image/outdoor_activities.ir_attachment_1423" alt="" class="img img-fluid o_we_custom_image" />
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <h3>Setting up Regular Tours</h3>
        <p>
            With the Outdoor Activities-Package you can offer regular experiences that your customers can conveniently book online. In our sample database, we offer diving outings on our trusty ship Deep Blue Something. As everyone of our
            expeditions requires our ship to get to the diving spot, our first step is to set up our ship. We do this by going to the <strong>Appointments-app </strong>and under <strong>Configuration</strong> selecting
            <strong>Resources</strong>. <br />
            There we click on <strong>New</strong>. Since we want several guests on the same tour, we set this resource to <strong>shareable</strong> and set the <strong>capacity </strong>to the 10 seats we have on our boat - this
            means that we can have up to 10 participants per tour.<br />
            <img src="/web/image/outdoor_activities.ir_attachment_1424" alt="" class="img img-fluid o_we_custom_image" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that our boat is ready, we need to create the tour itself. Still in the Appointments app, we select <strong>Appointments</strong> and click on <strong>New</strong>. There we set the <strong>Duration</strong>,
            <strong>Schedule</strong> and assign the relevant <strong>Resources</strong>.<br />
            Additionally we can choose whether we require up-front payment or wish to confirm every booking manually before booking a slot for our customers under the <strong>Options-Tab.</strong> Since we at Scuba Tours also provide our
            participants with equipment for their dives, we use the <strong>Questions-Tab</strong> to automatically ask relevant for information such as Shoe Size and Height upon booking.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="/web/image/outdoor_activities.ir_attachment_1429" alt="" class="img img-fluid o_we_custom_image" />
        </p>
        <div class="o_editor_banner user-select-none o_not_editable lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3">
            <i class="o_editor_banner_icon mb-3 fst-normal">üí°</i>
            <div class="w-100 px-3">
                <p>You can also create a Reservation Fee or Down-Payment and link it to the Appointment Type, if you prefer your customers to only pay partially upon booking.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Once you are happy with the settings of your event, you can edit the corresponding page by clicking the <strong>Go to Website-Smart Button. </strong>Once you are happy with the end product, change the slider in the top menu to
            <strong>Published</strong> so it appears on your website. Now you can lean back and watch the bookings come in!
        </p>
        <h3><br /></h3>
        <h3>Creating Special Events</h3>
        <p>
            Apart from regular recurring activities that can be booked via the calendar, you can also set up more elaborate special events and offer them to your customers via the website. For example, at Adam Diver we also offer an Open
            Water Diver-certification course. This section will take you through building this experience from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
            To get started on our first event, we need to go to the <strong>Events-App </strong>and click on <strong>New</strong>. In the following form, we can set up all the key information, such as the date and duration of the event, the
            location and whether there is a limited number of participants. <br />
            <img src="/web/image/outdoor_activities.ir_attachment_1450" alt="" class="img img-fluid o_we_custom_image img-thumbnail" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like with the appointments, you can select if and how much you want to charge for the registration via the <strong>Tickets-Tab</strong> and ask for relevant information in the <strong>Questions-Tab</strong>. In Addition you
            can configure automatic confirmation mails and reminders before the event via the<strong> Communication-Tab</strong>
        </p>
        <div class="o_editor_banner user-select-none o_not_editable lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-warning pb-0 pt-3">
            <i class="o_editor_banner_icon mb-3 fst-normal">‚ö†Ô∏è</i>
            <div class="w-100 px-3">
                <p>
                    To be able to sell tickets for your events via your website, you need to go to<strong> Events -&gt; Configuration </strong>first and activate the feature <strong>Online Ticketing.<br /></strong>To allow the integration
                    of this flow with the <strong>Sales-App</strong>, you also need to activate<strong> Tickets with Sale</strong>.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Once you are finished, you can edit the event description and related image on your website via the <strong>Go to Website-Smart Button</strong>. To make this event accessible to the whole wide world, simply change the ruler to
            <strong>Published </strong>and you good to go!
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like with the private booking, we need to block our only boat as a final step to avoid double booking. As a faster alternative to the previously shown flow, we can also use the
            <strong>Resource Leaves-feature</strong>. <br />
            To do so, we simply go to the <strong>Appointments-App</strong>, select <strong>Configuration</strong> and then <strong>Resource Leaves</strong>. Once there, select New, select the <strong>Resource</strong> and
            corresponding dates - you are now good to go! ü•≥<br />
            <img src="/web/image/outdoor_activities.ir_attachment_1451" alt="" class="img img-fluid o_we_custom_image" />

        <p> </p>
        <h3>Managing On-Site Payments</h3>
        <p>
            Some customers might spontaneously decide to join you for a tour or an event, instead of booking online in advance. This is where the POS-App shines, which allows your customer to simply pay on the spot and join the fun.
        </p>
        <div class="o_editor_banner user-select-none o_not_editable lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-warning pb-0 pt-3">
            <i class="o_editor_banner_icon mb-3 fst-normal">‚ö†Ô∏è</i>
            <div class="w-100 px-3 o_editable">
                <p>
                    To ensure that your POS is set up correctly, we strongly recommend following the step-by-step guide from our official documentation, which you can find linked below:<br />
                    <br />
                    <a href="https://www.odoo.com/documentation/latest/applications/sales/point_of_sale/configuration.html" class="btn btn-primary">POS Configuration</a>
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Once you have configured your shop and decided what your customers can purchase on site, the rest is a breeze in the park.<br />
            Simply click on your Point of Sale-App and select your "Open Register" under your Shop. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="/web/image/outdoor_activities.ir_attachment_1447" alt="" class="img img-fluid o_we_custom_image" />
        </p>
        <p>
            After entering the correct Opening Balance, you can simply select the corresponding product from your device and proceed to payment. This will allow you to choose a payment method from your pre-configured settings. 
            <br />
            In our case the customer is paying in exact cash.<br />
            <img src="/web/image/outdoor_activities.ir_attachment_1448" alt="" class="img img-fluid o_we_custom_image" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we validate the payment, and that's it! Congratulations, you just sold a dive tour! As a final step, you can choose send the receipt via mail or print it on the following screen. Please note that connecting your printer
            to the POS-App is also covered in our <a href="https://www.odoo.com/documentation/latest/applications/sales/point_of_sale/configuration.html">official documentation</a>.<br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            And just like that you are ready to go! ü§©<br />
            You can now follow up on leads and convert them into sales, set up your regular tours, host special events and sell them via your website or in person. <br />
