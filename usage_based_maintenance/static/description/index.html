<h3>Usage-Based Maintenance</h3>
<div class="o-paragraph">This module replaces static calendar-based scheduling with dynamic, usage-driven maintenance
    triggers. By monitoring the "Run-Time" or odometer values of each asset, the system automatically generates
    maintenance requests once predefined thresholds are reached. It is designed to optimize the service lifecycle of
    high-intensity machinery in the construction and agricultural sectors.
