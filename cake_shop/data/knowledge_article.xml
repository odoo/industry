        <p>Welcome to the <strong>Odoo Cake shop package</strong>!</p>
        <p>This setup is tailored for cake shop companies selling directly to consumers. Cake shops are businesses that specialize in offering a variety of cakes, pastries, and other confectionery items, catering to personalized and special orders for occasions like birthdays, weddings, and celebrations.</p>
        <p>They primarily use the Point of Sale application, along with Inventory, Sales, and Purchase apps. For businesses looking to expand online, the Website and E-commerce applications are ideal for showcasing products and handling online orders.</p>

                For custom cakes, you can use the <strong>MTO (Make to Order)</strong> method, which means ingredients are only ordered when a specific customer places an order. This helps you avoid keeping large amounts of stock for products you only make occasionally, ensuring that you only purchase what you need when you need it.
