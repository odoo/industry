        <hr/>
        <p>From the <strong>Hotel App</strong>, you can manage your bookings.<br/>The
            Hotel App relies on the Rental and Planning Apps binding, with a few
            customizations.
        </p>
        <h4>Let's book a room!</h4>
        <p>You have a future guest on the line willing to book a room? </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the Hotel App to appreciate the currently planned bookings with the
                Schedule.</li>
            <li>During an available period, click, drag and drop on a room line to create a slot.</li>
            <li>Click the Create Order to open the order form.</li>
            <li>Select or create a customer and then confirm the booking!</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>They want multiple rooms?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You now know how to create a new order.<br/>Let's replicate the previous steps but
                this time, without confirming the order (just saving it as draft).</li>
            <li>Once done, let's click, drag and drop on another room line to create a slot.</li>
            <li>This time click the Add to last order button to add this room to the booking and
                voila!</li>
            <li>Once done adding all the necessary rooms, click on a recently added slot and then
                click the rental order link.</li>
            <li>Check information and then confirm the booking.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Your customer wants to stay longer?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Type in the customer name in the Schedule search bar filtering by Customer.</li>
            <li>Click the tail of the corresponding booking and drag it to the requested date.</li>

        <ul>
