<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Deposit Management Module aims at enabling the management of deposit related products.</p>
<p>It enables:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <strong>definition of deposit categories </strong>and <strong>deposit products </strong>through the assignation of a deposit category;</li>
    <li>The <strong>assignation of deposit products</strong> to products to capture they are sold involving a deposit;</li>
    <li><strong>Accounting for deposit amount</strong> when selling products involving deposits thanks to taxes;</li>
    <li>The <strong>return of deposit products</strong> during deliveries;</li>
    <li>The <strong>break down of products</strong> into sub-products automatically, accounting for deposits (Auto-BoM).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Definition of deposit categories and deposit products</h2>
<p>Deposit categories are product categories with the setting Is a Deposit Category set.</p>
<p>Deposit products are products with a deposit category assigned.</p>
<p>Assigning a deposit category to a product makes it a deposit product and allows to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Expose in the deposit product form the deposit amount;</li>
    <li>Automatically create and assign the deposit taxes to the deposit product with the deposit amount;</li>
    <li>Make the deposit product available for assignation to sell-able products.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assignation of deposit product</h2>
<p>Deposit products can be assigned to sell-able products by selecting the deposit product in the Total Deposits product form field.</p>
<p>When a deposit product is assigned to a product:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The deposit product tax is assigned to the sell-able product automatically;</li>
    <li>If the sell-able product is defined with Auto-BoM contained products, an additional field for By-Deposit is made available to define the deposit product resulting from the product break down.</li>
</ul>

        <div class="o-paragraph">Example explained for a Beer crate:</div>
        <ul>
            <li>A beer crate contains 24 beer bottles:</li>
            <li>A beer crate has a deposit for the crate of 2.1€;</li>
            <li>Each beer bottle has a deposit for the container of 0.1€;</li>
            <li>As a result, the Total deposits for a sell-able beer crate is 4.5€ (2.1+24x0.1);</li>
            <li>Splitting the beer crate leads to an empty beer crate, the By-Deposit product with a deposit of 2.1€, and 24 bottles of beer having their deposits of 0.1€.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<h2>Accounting for deposit in sales</h2>
<p>The sell-able products come with a fixed tax for deposits if they are assigned a Total Deposit product. <br/>
As a result, each sale order lines of such product come with a deposit tax, which amount is exposed in sale order columns for clarity.</p>
<p>The total deposit taxes of the sale order is computed and made available through the deposit tax group near the total of the order. </p>

    <div class="o_editor_banner_content o-contenteditable-true w-100 px-3" contenteditable="true">
        <p>In other words, once your sell-able products are assigned the appropriate deposit products, you don't need to care about it during your sales.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p> <br/></p>
<h2>Returning deposit products during deliveries</h2>
<p>When delivering products to your customers, proceed to a return and capture the deposit products they return. <br/>
Validate the return, which captures the returned deposit products in the customer sale order.</p>
<p>Similarly from your Point of Sale (PoS), when your customers return deposit products, simply select the deposit product and change its sign in the PoS order to account for it as a return.</p>
<p> <br/></p>
<h2>Breaking down products accounting for deposits (Auto-BoM)</h2>
<p>The Auto-BoM capability aims at facilitating the inventory management of products which can be broken down, so that you can sell the sub-products without having to worry about the stock management.</p>
<p>To define such break down pattern:</p>
<ul>
    <li>On a product form indicate in the Auto-BoM section the products it's made of;</li>
    <li>Assign if needed the By-Deposit product.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, here is what is automated:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A Bill of Material (BoM) is created to obtain sub-products from the product, and By-Deposit if defined as by-product;</li>
    <li>An automated replenishment rule is created for each warehouse to replenish sub-products from product as soon as you need some.</li>
</ul>

        <div class="o-paragraph">This capability is unfortunately not functional with Point of Sale App (PoS), since its way of interacting with the stock is different. <br/>
            We advise you to use kits in such case or to proceed to regular inventory update.</div>
