        <h1>Photography</h1>
        <p>
            This app is designed for small photography studios, including freelancers and small organizations. It is built to cater to both corporate clients (team building events, professional events, product photography) and individual
            clients (weddings, family events, pregnancy shoots, pet shoots, etc.).
        </p>
        <h1>External Events</h1>
        <h2>Lead generation and management</h2>
        <h3>Through the website</h3>
        <p>From the website, a potential client can ask for a quote or simply get in touch. They can fill some extra details about their needs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Type of shooting session/event</li>
            <li>Potential date</li>
            <li>Their contact information</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Email alias</h3>
        <p>Leads can come via email using info@&lt;your_odoo&gt;.odoo.com.</p>
        <p>Once a lead has been created, you can use it as a central point from where you can reach your customer. Any reply they send will directly arrive on the lead!</p>
        <h2>Quote</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
            After qualification through a call or meeting, a quote is generated detailing the event requirements. Clients can sign online to confirm the quote. You can use the quote templates (which will customize the emails that get sent to
            the customer). Don't hesitate to customize them!
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><br /></p>
        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p>
            Once the quote is confirmed, a project is created for the shooting session. You can modify these template projects to suit your needs, e.g. by adding tasks to them. You don't want to use project management? Feel free to replace the
            product by their 'no-service' equivalent to avoid the creation of a project.
        </p>
        <h1>Studio Shoots</h1>
        <h2>Lead generation</h2>
        <p>From the website or via the email alias, as above.</p>
        <h2>Quote</h2>
        <p>Once qualified (call/meeting), a quote is created for the shooting with details on schedule and expected service etc. Customer can sign online to confirm.</p>
        <h2>Appointment</h2>
        <p>
            Clients get a link to book an appointment - this link can be sent from a Sales Order or from a Task. The link directly binds to the correct appointment type and is easy to remember or type manually
            (e.g. https://&lt;your_odoo&gt;.odoo.com/book/studio). The appointment page is not publicly available on the website, you can only register an appointment when given the link.
        </p>
        <p>The client can book whatever time slot they would like from there.</p>
        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p>Once the quote is confirmed, a project is created for the shooting session, as above.</p>
