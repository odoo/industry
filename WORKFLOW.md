## Development Workflow

### Pre-Development Phase

#### 1. Requirements Gathering

**For Each Industry Module:**

```
Step 1: Business Analysis
├── Identify core business processes
├── Map current workflows
├── Document pain points
├── List desired features
└── Define success metrics

Step 2: Data Requirements
├── Inventory existing data sources
├── Define data migration needs
├── Identify integration points
└── Plan data validation rules

Step 3: User Stories
├── Create user personas
├── Write user stories
├── Prioritize features
└── Define acceptance criteria
```

**Template for Business Analysis:**

```markdown
## [Industry Module Name] - Business Analysis

### Current State
- Business processes: [List current processes]
- Pain points: [List challenges]
- Tools in use: [Current software/tools]

### Desired State
- Goals: [What you want to achieve]
- Required features: [Must-have features]
- Nice-to-have features: [Optional features]

### Success Metrics
- KPI 1: [Define metric]
- KPI 2: [Define metric]
- Timeline: [Expected implementation time]
```

#### 2. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/greeklekissle/industry-mozin_conceito.git
cd industry-mozin_conceito

# Set up Python environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (requires Odoo installation)
# Follow Odoo installation guide: https://www.odoo.com/documentation/master/administration/install/
```

#### 3. Development Database Setup

```bash
# Create development database for specific industry
./run_industry.sh -n [industry_name] -d -i

# Examples:
./run_industry.sh -n fast_food -d -i
./run_industry.sh -n handyman -d -i
./run_industry.sh -n agriculture_shop -d -i
```

### Development Phase

#### 1. Module Structure Understanding

Each module follows this structure:

```
module_name/
├── __init__.py                 # Module initialization
├── __manifest__.py             # Module metadata and dependencies
├── data/                       # Master data (loaded in order)
│   ├── res_config_settings.xml
│   ├── product_category.xml
│   ├── product_product.xml
│   └── knowledge_article.xml
├── demo/                       # Demo/sample data
│   ├── res_partner.xml
│   ├── sale_order.xml
│   └── ...
├── i18n/                       # Translations
├── images/                     # Module images
└── static/                     # Static assets
    ├── json/                   # JSON templates
    └── src/
        └── js/                 # JavaScript files
```

#### 2. Customization Workflow

**A. Adding Custom Fields**

```bash
# Start the server with development mode
./run_industry.sh -n [industry_name]

# In Odoo UI:
# 1. Enable Developer Mode (Settings → Activate Developer Mode)
# 2. Navigate to Settings → Technical → Database Structure → Models
# 3. Find your model (e.g., product.product, sale.order)
# 4. Add custom fields using Web Studio (if available)
# 5. Export customizations to XML
```

**B. Creating Custom Views**

Create XML file in `data/` directory:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<odoo>
    <record id="custom_view_id" model="ir.ui.view">
        <field name="name">custom.view.name</field>
        <field name="model">target.model</field>
        <field name="arch" type="xml">
            <!-- Your view definition -->
        </field>
    </record>
</odoo>
```

**C. Adding Automation Rules**

```xml
<record id="automation_rule_id" model="base.automation">
    <field name="name">Rule Name</field>
    <field name="model_id" ref="model_sale_order"/>
    <field name="trigger">on_create</field>
    <field name="action_server_ids" eval="[(6, 0, [ref('action_server_id')])]"/>
</record>
```

#### 3. Code Standards

**Python Code Guidelines:**

```python
# Follow Odoo coding guidelines
# https://www.odoo.com/documentation/master/developer/reference/backend/guidelines.html

class CustomModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'custom.model'
    _description = 'Custom Model Description'
    
    # Fields
    name = fields.Char(string='Name', required=True)
    
    # Methods
    def custom_method(self):
        """Method documentation."""
        pass
```

**XML Data Guidelines:**

```xml
<!-- Use consistent naming -->
<!-- Prefix IDs with module name -->
<!-- Add comments for complex logic -->

<record id="module_name_record_id" model="ir.model">
    <!-- Configuration -->
</record>
```
