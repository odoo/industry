            <h3>Projects Based on Templates</h3>
            <p>For products like custom tables or wood frames, Odoo can automatically create a new project based on a pre-defined template upon sale. Key benefits include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Automatic project creation for new orders.</li>
                <li>Consistency in project structure, tasks, and timesheets.</li>
                <li>Ability to invoice clients based on completion or milestones.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Tasks in a Global Project</h3>
            <p>For items such as custom desks, tasks can be created within a larger, ongoing project, which allows for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Task creation upon sale within an existing project framework.</li>
                <li>Tracking time spent on individual tasks through timesheets for billing accuracy.</li>
                <li>Billing upon task or service completion.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Advantages of Automated Projects and Tasks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Projects and tasks are created without manual input, improving efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Standardization:</strong> Pre-defined templates ensure consistent project structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Time Tracking:</strong> Timesheets make it easy to track work hours and bill clients accordingly.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Using Quotation Templates for Roofing Projects</h2>
            <p>Odooâ€™s quotation templates simplify complex estimates, especially for projects like roofing where material calculations are needed.</p>
            
            <h3>Automatic Material Calculations</h3>
            <p>Using a quotation template, you can set up material requirements based on project dimensions. This feature enables you to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Calculate exact quantities of materials like tiles, beams, and insulation based on project dimensions.</li>
                <li>Adjust margins on materials directly in the quotation to ensure profitability.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Simplified Quotations</h3>
            <p>For a clean, professional look, Odoo allows you to present a summarized quotation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Select <strong>Send Simplified Quotation</strong> to hide detailed lines and provide an overview for customers.</li><li>If you wish to change the portal view too you can select in sales settings the "Simplified Quotations</li>
                <li>If using sections, sales order lines will be grouped under each section for better clarity.</li>
                <li>Sections without sales order lines will display only the project name.</li>
            </ul><h3>Simplified Invoices</h3>
            <p>Following the same logic, you can also send simplified invoices. To do so:</p><ul><li>Select <strong>Simplified Invoice</strong>in report in the contact view to hide detailed lines and provide an overview for customers.</li><li>If using sections, sales order lines will be grouped under each section for better clarity.</li></ul><h3>Benefits of Customized Quotations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Automated material calculations save time and reduce errors.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Adjust margins and create tailored quotations for various project sizes.</li>
                <li><strong>Presentation:</strong> Simplified quotation views help communicate effectively with customers.</li>
