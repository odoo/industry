<h2><strong>1. Crafting a beer</strong></h2>
 <hr/>
<p><strong><span class="h3-fs">Create a Recipe </span></strong></p>
<p>In the manufacturing application, you can create a bill of materials to define how the beer should be crafted. </p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Indicate what will be the finished product </strong>at the end of your recipe and the quantity that should be produced with the recipe. for example:</li>
    <li class="oe-nested">
        <ul>
            <li>Beer bottle (33cl), 3000 units (+- 10hL)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Then <strong>create and add the components </strong>you need, the quantity required and you can also indicate in which operation it will be consumed, for example:</li>
    <li class="oe-nested">
        <ul>
            <li>Water - Good, no inventory tracking - Mashing</li>
            <li>Malt - Goods, inventory tracking by lot. <br/></li>
            <li>Hops - Goods, inventory tracking by lot.</li>
            <li>Yeast - Goods, inventory tracking by lot.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Create and add the By-product</strong>s, for example:Spent Grain</li>
    <li class="oe-nested">
        <ul>
            <li>Spent Grain</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Create the operations</strong> of your recipe with the right work center, for example:</li>
    <li class="oe-nested">
        <ul>
            <li>Mashing - Work center: Mash tun</li>
            <li>Lautering - Work center: Lauter tun</li>
            <li>Boiling - Work center: Kettle</li>
            <li>Fermenting - Work center: Fermentation Vessel</li>
            <li>Filtering - Work center: Fermentation Vessel</li>
            <li>Bottling - Work center: Bottler</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Indicate if there are instructions</strong> the operator should do during some operation, for example:</li>
    <li class="oe-nested">
        <ul>
            <li>Register the quantity of spent grain produced at the end of the lautering.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Now that the recipe is ready, you can create a manufacturing order but you will see that if you don't have the components to create your beer, you will need to purchase the required components.</p>
<div data-oe-protected="true" class="o_editor_banner o_not_editable lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3">
    <i class="o_editor_banner_icon mb-3 fst-normal">üöÄ</i>
    <div data-oe-protected="false" class="w-100 px-3">
        <p>It is interesting to mention that a lot of microbreweries do not have the machines for the kegging but it is possible to create a separate bill of Materials with the type subcontracting, if the bottling is made externally.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<a class="btn btn-primary mb-2" href="/odoo?tour=manufacturing_tour" data-bs-original-title="" title="">Crafting a beer Tutorial</a>
<p> <br/></p>
<p><span class="h3-fs"><strong>Purchase and receive components</strong></span></p>
<p>Go into the purchase application and create a new purchase order with all the components you need to execute your recipe. Make sure you buy enough quantity of each components and validate the order.</p>
<p>Once it is confirmed a delivery order should have been created meaning you are waiting for the vendor to deliver the goods.</p>
<p>Go on the delivery order and indicate the quantity you received and create the lot numbers for each components.</p>
<p>Validate the delivery and check your inventory, now you have everything </p>
<p> <br/></p>
<p><strong><span class="h3-fs">Start brewing</span></strong></p>
<p>Now that you have all the components required to craft the beer, let's start brewing beer. In the manufacturing application, create a new manufacturing order for the bill of materials you made for your recipe.</p>
<p>Then, from the "Shop Floor" application, execute the different operations and follow the instruction as you were the operator.</p>
<p>Once you finished all the operations, you should now be ready to sell your crafted beer.</p>
<p> <br/></p>
<h2><strong>2. Selling the beer</strong></h2>
 <hr/>
<p><strong><span class="h3-fs">Sell your products and deliver it to a bar</span></strong></p>
<p>By default the "Contact us" page of the website will send you an email, but you can edit the page and change the behavior of the submit button to create a lead into the CRM application instead.</p>
<p>Now you can generate a new lead by submitting the form and go into the CRM application to find this new lead. As the salesperson in charge of this lead, you can exchange email with the customer directly with the chatter and finally you can schedule a meeting with him. </p>
<p>After (or during) the meeting, you can use the button "New Quotation" to create an offer for the customer. Once it is done, send it to the customer.</p>
<p>You can then use the "Preview" button on the offer to see the result and accept it as if you were the customer!</p>
<p>Now if you go back on the quotation in the Sales application, you will see that it is now a confirmed order and a delivery order has been created. Go on that delivery order and validate it.  </p>
<p>You can now finalize the flow by creating the invoice. </p>
<div data-oe-protected="true" class="o_editor_banner o_not_editable lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3">
    <i class="o_editor_banner_icon mb-3 fst-normal">üí°</i>
    <div data-oe-protected="false" class="w-100 px-3">
        <p data-o-mail-quote="1" data-o-mail-quote-node="1">From the Sales application, you can create standardized offer to make the creation of offers more efficient. For example you can have a template with all your beers already in it. You can also create pricelists that you can assign on your customers too;</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h3> <br/></h3>
<p><span class="h3-fs"><strong>Visit the website and make an order.</strong></span></p>
<p>From the website application, you can access the Navigate on the page "Shop". You will see that your products may not be published yet. Click on a product to land on the product page, customize it then publish it so visitors can start ordering it.</p>
<p>Add products in your cart and pay using the payment method "Demo" which is a fake payment method you can use to test flows.</p>
<p>Ecommerce can be used to create a brand that is more than a beer. You can use it to do "cross-selling" by adding some merchandising products (t-shirt, sweet shirt, beer glass, ...) that will be bought by your fans that will become your ambassadors.</p>
<p> <br/></p>
<p><span class="h3-fs"><strong>Analyse your sales.</strong></span></p>
<p>On top of all the reporting you can find in the different applications, you can consult the dashboard application to follow the volume of Sales you have made.</p>
<div data-oe-protected="true" class="o_editor_banner o_not_editable lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3">
    <i class="o_editor_banner_icon mb-3 fst-normal">üöÄ</i>
    <div data-oe-protected="false" class="w-100 px-3">
        <p>If you need to declare your <strong>periodic sales in a consolidated volume</strong>, ensure your unit of measure and products are correctly configured and use the Pivot Table in Sales App &gt; Reporting &gt; Sales. </p>
        <p>You can configure a monthly sales overview using the "Volume" Measure, selecting "Product categories" in X axis and "Order date &gt; Month" in Y axis.</p>
        <p>Want to know more about unit of measures ?</p>

<h2><strong>3. Visiting the Brewery </strong></h2>
 <hr/>
<p><strong><span class="h3-fs">Schedule a visit from the website.</span></strong> <br/></p>
<p>In the Appointment app, you can create an agenda for the visits of the brewery. You can mention which employee will do the visit and you can ask an upcoming payment to book and link the product "Visit of the brewery". Once everything is fine, you can publish it and then hit the button "Go to Website" to see the website page where future visitors can book online a visit of the brewery.</p>
<p>You can pick a time and pay to finalize the booking.</p>
<div data-oe-protected="true" class="o_editor_banner o_not_editable lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3">
    <i class="o_editor_banner_icon mb-3 fst-normal">üí°</i>
    <div data-oe-protected="false" class="w-100 px-3">
        <p>The appointment app can also be used to share your availability with a customer or a vendor if you want him to book a meeting with you.</p>

<p><span class="h3-fs"><strong>Take an order at the Bar</strong></span> <br/></p>
<p>After the visit, it is always great for visitors to be able to share a moment around the good beer. Go into the "Point Of Sales" application and create a product to sell in your bar/restaurant (e.g. Draft beer, snack, ...).</p>
<p>Now go back in the "Point of Sales" dashboard and start a Session of the bar (or restaurant), indicate how much cash you have when opening the bar. An now you are ready to take an order.</p>
<p>Select a table (inside or outside), then select the ordered products and confirm the order. </p>
<p>At any time you can select a table and register the payment to close the table.</p>
