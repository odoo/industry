                <h3>Create a Recipe&nbsp;</h3>
                <p>In the manufacturing application, you can&nbsp;create a bill of materials to define how the beer should be crafted.&nbsp;</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Indicate what will be the finished product at the end of your recipe and the quantity that should be&nbsp;produced with the recipe. for example:</li>
                    <li class="oe-nested">
                        <ol>
                            <li>Beer bottle&nbsp;(33cl),&nbsp;3000 units (+- 10hL)</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Then create and add the components you need, the quantity required and you can also indicate in which operation it will be consumed, for example:</li>
                    <li class="oe-nested">
                        <ol>
                            <li>Water -&nbsp;Type consumable - Mashing</li>
                            <li>Malt - Type&nbsp;Storable - Tracking by lot.<br/></li>
                            <li>Hops - Type&nbsp;Storable - Tracking by lot.</li>
                            <li>Yeast&nbsp;- Type&nbsp;Storable - Tracking by lot.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Create and add the By-products, for example:</li>
                    <li class="oe-nested">
                        <ol>
                            <li>Spent Grain</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Create the operations of your recipe with the right work center, for example:</li>
                    <li class="oe-nested">
                        <ol>
                            <li>Mashing - Work center: Mash tun</li>
                            <li>Lautering&nbsp;- Work center: Lauter tun</li>
                            <li>Boiling&nbsp;- Work center: Kettle</li>
                            <li>Fermenting&nbsp;- Work center: Fermentation Vessel</li>
                            <li>Filtering&nbsp;- Work center: Fermentation Vessel</li>
                            <li>Bottling&nbsp;- Work center: Bottler</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Indicate if there are instructions the operator should do during some operation, for example:</li>
                    <li class="oe-nested">
                        <ol>
                            <li>Register the quantity of spent grain produced at the end of the lautering.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
               <p>Now that the recipe is ready, you can create a manufacturing order but you will see that if you don't have the components to create your beer, you will need to purchase the required components.</p>
                <p>Remark: It is interesting to mention that a lot of microbreweries do not have the machines for the kegging but it is possible to create a separate bill of Materials with the type subcontracting, if the bottling is made externally.</p>
                <h3>Purchase and receive components</h3>
                <p>Go into the purchase application and create a new purchase order with all the components you need to execute your recipe. Make sure you buy enough quantity of each components and validate the order.</p>
                <p>Once it is confirmed a delivery order should have been created meaning you are waiting for the vendor to deliver the goods.</p>
                <p>Go on the delivery order and indicate the quantity you received and&nbsp;create the lot numbers for each components.</p>
                <p>Validate the delivery and check your inventory, now you have everything&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>Start brewing</h3>
                <p>Now that you have all the components required to craft the beer,&nbsp;let's&nbsp;start brewing beer. In the manufacturing application, create a new manufacturing order for the bill of materials you made for your recipe.</p>
                <p>Then, from the "Shop Floor" application, execute the different operations and follow the instruction as you were the operator.</p>
                <p>Once you finished all the operations, you should now be ready to sell your crafted beer.</p>
                <h2><strong>Business flow 2: Selling the beer</strong></h2>
                <h3>Sell your products and deliver it to a bar</h3>
                <p>By default the "Contact us" page of the website will send you an email, but you can edit the page and change the behavior of the submit button to&nbsp;create a lead into the CRM application instead.</p>
                <p>
                    Now you can generate a new lead by submitting the form and go into the CRM application to find this new lead. As the&nbsp;salesperson in charge of this lead, you can exchange email with the customer directly with the chatter
                    and finally you can schedule a meeting with him.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>After (or during) the meeting, you can use the button "New Quotation" to create an offer for the customer. Once it is done, send it to the customer.</p>
                <p>You can then use the "Preview" button on the offer to see the result and accept it as if you were the customer!</p>
                <p>Now if you go back on the quotation in the Sales application,&nbsp;you will see that it is now a confirmed order and a delivery order has been created. Go on that&nbsp;delivery order and&nbsp;validate it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p>You can now finalize the flow by creating the invoice.</p>

                    Ecommerce can be used to&nbsp;create a brand that is more than a beer. You can use it to do "cross-selling"&nbsp;by adding some merchandising products (t-shirt, sweet shirt, beer glass, ...) that will be bought by your fans that will
                    become your ambassadors.
