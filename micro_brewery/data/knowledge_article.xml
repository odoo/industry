<h2><strong>Crafting üì¶</strong></h2>
 <hr/>
<h3>Create a recipe</h3>
<p>In the manufacturing application, you can create a bill of materials to define how the beer should be crafted. </p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Indicate what will be the finished product </strong>at the end of your recipe and the quantity that should be produced with the recipe. for example:</li>
    <li class="oe-nested">
        <ul>
            <li>Beer bottle (33cl), 3000 units (+- 10hL)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Then <strong>create and add the components </strong>you need, the quantity required and you can also indicate in which operation it will be consumed, for example:</li>
    <li class="oe-nested">
        <ul>
            <li>Water - Good, no inventory tracking - Mashing</li>
            <li>Malt - Goods, inventory tracking by lot. <br/></li>
            <li>Hops - Goods, inventory tracking by lot.</li>
            <li>Yeast - Goods, inventory tracking by lot.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Create and add the By-product</strong>s, for example:Spent Grain</li>
    <li class="oe-nested">
        <ul>
            <li>Spent Grain</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Create the operations</strong> of your recipe with the right work center, for example:</li>
    <li class="oe-nested">
        <ul>
            <li>Mashing - Work center: Mash tun</li>
            <li>Lautering - Work center: Lauter tun</li>
            <li>Boiling - Work center: Kettle</li>
            <li>Fermenting - Work center: Fermentation Vessel</li>
            <li>Filtering - Work center: Fermentation Vessel</li>
            <li>Bottling - Work center: Bottler</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Indicate if there are instructions</strong> the operator should do during some operation, for example:</li>
    <li class="oe-nested">
        <ul>
            <li>Register the quantity of spent grain produced at the end of the lautering.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Now that the recipe is ready, you can create a manufacturing order but you will see that if you don't have the components to create your beer, you will need to purchase the required components.</p>
<div data-oe-protected="true" class="o_editor_banner o_not_editable lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3">
    <i class="o_editor_banner_icon mb-3 fst-normal">üöÄ</i>
    <div data-oe-protected="false" class="w-100 px-3">
        <p>It is interesting to mention that a lot of microbreweries do not have the machines for the kegging but it is possible to create a separate bill of Materials with the type subcontracting, if the bottling is made externally.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p> <br/></p>
<h3>Purchase and receive components</h3>
<p>Go into the purchase application and create a new purchase order with all the components you need to execute your recipe. Make sure you buy enough quantity of each components and validate the order.</p>
<p>Once it is confirmed a delivery order should have been created meaning you are waiting for the vendor to deliver the goods.</p>
<p>Go on the delivery order and indicate the quantity you received and create the lot numbers for each components.</p>
<p>Validate the delivery and check your inventory, now you have everything </p>
<p> <br/></p>
<h3>Start brewing</h3>
<p>Now that you have all the components required to craft the beer, let's start brewing beer. In the manufacturing application, create a new manufacturing order for the bill of materials you made for your recipe.</p>
<p>Then, from the "Shop Floor" application, execute the different operations and follow the instruction as you were the operator.</p>
<p>Once you finished all the operations, you should now be ready to sell your crafted beer.</p>
<p> <br/></p>
<h3 class="">Products and Bills of Material</h3>
<p>There are two ways to handle your products and bills of material, each coming with pros and cons.</p>
<h5>Kits only / Inventory in bottles</h5>
<p>The kit defines the assembly of beer bottles and a crate into a beer box.</p>
<p>We setup an example of this setup with the blond beer bottle and box products in this module.</p>
<div class="o_editor_banner user-select-none o-contenteditable-false lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-success pb-0 pt-3" data-oe-role="status" contenteditable="false" role="status">

    <div class="o_editor_banner_content o-contenteditable-true w-100 px-3" contenteditable="true">
        <ul><li>The inventory is driven by beer bottles.</li><li>The bottled beer is directly the finished product and no semi-finished bottle product is required.</li></ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="o_editor_banner user-select-none o-contenteditable-false lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-warning pb-0 pt-3" data-oe-role="status" contenteditable="false" role="status">
    <i class="o_editor_banner_icon mb-3 fst-normal" data-oe-aria-label="Banner Warning" aria-label="Banner Warning">‚ö†Ô∏è</i>
    <div class="o_editor_banner_content o-contenteditable-true w-100 px-3" contenteditable="true">
        <ul><li>When moving boxes from a place to another using box product, in practice, beer bottles and deposits are moved (see corresponding deliveries).</li><li>The count on beer boxes is informative only since boxes are considered available as soon as the components, beer bottles and crate, are available.</li></ul>
    </div>
</div>
<h5 class="">Automated manufacturing orders / Inventory in crates</h5>
<p>Automated manufacturing order bill of materials define how semi-finished bottles are packaged into boxes and how boxes can be split into beer bottles.</p>
<p>We setup an example of this setup with the lager and brown beer bottle and box products in this module.</p>
<div class="o_editor_banner user-select-none o-contenteditable-false lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-success pb-0 pt-3" data-oe-role="status" contenteditable="false" role="status">

    <div class="o_editor_banner_content o-contenteditable-true w-100 px-3" contenteditable="true">
        <ul><li>The inventory is driven by beer boxes.</li><li>Deliveries of beer boxes are clear.</li><li>The split of beer box into beer bottles a the bar is clear.</li></ul>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="o_editor_banner user-select-none o-contenteditable-false lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-warning pb-0 pt-3" data-oe-role="status" contenteditable="false" role="status">
    <i class="o_editor_banner_icon mb-3 fst-normal" data-oe-aria-label="Banner Warning" aria-label="Banner Warning">‚ö†Ô∏è</i>
    <div class="o_editor_banner_content o-contenteditable-true w-100 px-3" contenteditable="true">
        <ul><li>A semi-finished beer bottle unit product is required to be packaged into boxes, which in practice the same as the as the finished product beer bottle, the last one being here to support the split use case at the bar.</li><li>Two bills of material are needed.</li></ul>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="o_editor_banner lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3 o-contenteditable-false" data-oe-protected="true" data-oe-role="status" contenteditable="false" role="status">

    <div class="w-100 px-3 o_editor_banner_content o-contenteditable-true" data-oe-protected="false" contenteditable="true">
        <p>If you want to automatically split products sold in a specific packaging such as beer boxes, precise a unit sale product in the so-called field and the number of units contained.</p>
        <p>This will automatically create a Bill of Material and process a Manufacture Order each time you need to split your product and reflect this operation in your stock perfectly.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bown Beer - Box in 24x33cl is your main product</li>
            <li>Bown Beer - Bottle in 33cl is the unit sale product</li>
            <li>Deposit 4.5 is the complete deposit product (deposits of all bottles and crate)</li>
            <li>Deposit 2.1 is the empty deposit product</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Every time you need to sell a single Bown Beer - Bottle, if you don't have enough in stock, it will split a Bown Beer - Box, when you have some in stock, in 24 units and take into account an extra empty bin that will be left at the end.</p>
        <p>The inventory of all products will be updated accordingly.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h5>With or without crate inventory?</h5>
<p>The described setup accounts for the inventory management of crates.</p>
<p>It is however possible to neglect this by:</p>
<ul><li>removing the deposit products from the bill of materials</li><li>removing the tracking of deposit products (in the product form</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Selling üí∏</strong></h2>
 <hr/>
<h3><strong><span class="h3-fs">Sell your products and deliver it to a bar</span></strong></h3>
<p>By default the "Contact us" page of the website will send you an email, but you can edit the page and change the behavior of the submit button to create a lead into the CRM application instead.</p>
<p>Now you can generate a new lead by submitting the form and go into the CRM application to find this new lead. As the salesperson in charge of this lead, you can exchange email with the customer directly with the chatter and finally you can schedule a meeting with him. </p>
<p>After (or during) the meeting, you can use the button "New Quotation" to create an offer for the customer. Once it is done, send it to the customer.</p>
<p>You can then use the "Preview" button on the offer to see the result and accept it as if you were the customer!</p>
<p>Now if you go back on the quotation in the Sales application, you will see that it is now a confirmed order and a delivery order has been created. Go on that delivery order and validate it.  </p>
<p>You can now finalize the flow by creating the invoice. </p>

<h2>Deposit Management üçª</h2>
<hr contenteditable="false"></hr>
<p>Manage your deposit more precisely and efficiently than ever before.</p>
<h3>Deposit assignation</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Create deposit products for each different type of consigns.</li>
    <li>Apply DEP XX taxes to those products, creating some if necessary, and assign them a category with "Is a deposit category" set like the Deposit category.</li>
    <li>Set a deposit product on your product to apply these taxes. This will ensure that you invoice correctly the price of consigns.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deposit return from customers</h3>
<ul><li>
        Collect deposit when you deliver your customer. It is easy. When validating your delivery, you can directly set a "Return" and precisely count the number of each type of deposit your customer gave you. It will automatically be
        reflected on his invoice or issue a credit note.
    </li>
<li>You can also collect deposit directly on your Point of Sale. Select the correct product and encode a negative quantity.</li>

<h3>Excise Management üßæ</h3>
<p>In case you import or purchase products for which excises need to be recorded, you can handle it with this package.</p>
<p>Excise management consists in two dimensions in this package:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The maintenance of excise categories and the assignation of excises to products</li>
    <li>The reporting of received and delivered excise concerned products, a legal implication for any fiscal deposit</li>

<p><strong>Excise categories maintenance</strong></p>
<p>From the <strong>Inventory app</strong>, open the Excise categories from the menu Configuration / Excise Categories. <br/>Here you can define new and maintain existing excise categories.</p>
<p>Imagine you create a new category of products which need excise management...</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new excise category defining its name, description and reporting unit following the legislation which applies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then create your product: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Define the required product fields. </li>
    <li>Assign the relevant excise category, input the Excise Amount and the Excise Quantity in the reporting unit and then save your product.</li>

<p><strong>Excise reporting</strong></p>
<p>On a regular basis, excises need to be declared. To support you with this duty, a report is setup to reach the quantity by excise category entering and exiting your fiscal deposit warehouse.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Open the <strong>Inventory app</strong> and reach from the Reporting menu the Excises.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Entry from FD corresponds to products entering you fiscal deposit warehouse from the fiscal deposit of a supplier. To define such suppliers, adapt their fiscal position to handle excise tax.</li>
            <li>Exit to FD refers to products exiting your fiscal deposit warehouse to the fiscal deposit of a customer. To define such customers, adapt their fiscal position to handle excise tax.</li>
            <li>Exit means that products exited your fiscal deposit, to another warehouse of your or through a delivery to a customer without fiscal deposit warehouse.</li>
            <li>Entry is here in case you purchase products or are returned products not from a fiscal deposit warehouse. In such case, you ask for excise credits with your excise declaration.</li>
            <li>Transfer is here to handle the transfers between multiple fiscal deposit warehouses of yours.</li>
