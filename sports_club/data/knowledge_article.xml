        <p><br /></p>
        <h2>1. Gears<br /></h2>
        <hr />
        <p>The Club Sells sport gears through 2 channels:</p>
        <p>
            <br />
            a) Equipment can be bought on the Club eShop, with a <font class="text-o-color-1"><strong>paid delivery</strong></font> at home or a <strong><font class="text-o-color-1">free pick up</font></strong> at the Club, or directly from the
            Club, through their dedicated "Shop" Point of Sale. When rackets are bought on the eShop, a basic <font class="text-o-color-1"><strong>up-sell</strong></font> is suggested: Add a towel or some balls to your order.
        </p>
        <p>
            b) For players that need something on the spot, the <font class="text-o-color-1"><strong>SHOP </strong></font><font class="text-black">POS</font> <font class="text-black">can </font>also be used. 
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <h2>2. Bar Management<br /></h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
            a) The Club has a bar where players can grab something to eat between games or have a beer.<br />
            It can be accessed in
            <strong>
                <font class="text-o-color-1">Point of Sales &gt; Bar </font><font class="text-black"><span style="font-weight: normal;">and contains some basic products.</span></font>
            </strong>
            <br />
            Customers can pay by through different means, including by adding the note to their account.
        </p>
        <p>
            b) Planning for the Bar is also handled from Odoo. Simple <strong><font class="text-o-color-1">recurring shifts</font></strong> are created and assigned to the staff members.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <h2>3. Court Booking </h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
            There are two appointment types configured for the Club.<br />
            <br />
            a) The first one "<strong><font class="text-o-color-1">Court Booking</font></strong>" allows players to book a court for a session of 60 minutes. Slots start every 30 minutes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            b) The other one, "<strong><font class="text-o-color-1">Friday night free play"</font></strong> is only available on Fridays and allows player to join other games.
        </p>
        <blockquote data-o-mail-quote-node="1" data-o-mail-quote="1">
            Notes: This is because the courts are configured as shareable. As long as a free spot is left, players can register and share the resource (=the courts) with others.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            On top of that, employees working behind the counter can also take phone calls and book some courts. For this, they use the <strong><font class="text-o-color-1">Appointments &gt; Resource Schedule</font></strong> menu. 
        </p>
