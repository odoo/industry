        <h1>Surveyor</h1>
        <p>This setup is for surveyors that sell services like land measurement  &amp; mapping, planning permission, mediation counsel, etc to private customers as well as companies (architect, notary, real estate, ‚Ä¶).</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>They need a website to collect new leads and give access to produced documents.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>They also need subscriptions for long term relationships with larger companies that require several services per year.</p>

        <h1>Business flows</h1>
        <h2>Flow 1: Request a Quote</h2>
        <h3>From the website</h3>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>Visit the Contact us page: This form will create an opportunity in the CRM, with the right information.</p>
        <h3>Surveyor meets the client</h3>
        <p>From the CRM, schedule a call or a meeting. Based on the client‚Äôs need, you can create a quotation using the quotation templates.</p>
        <h3>(From a phone call)</h3>
        <p>Quicker flow where the surveyor can directly create and send a quote to the lead.</p>
        <h2>Flow 2: Buy  &amp; deliver services</h2>
        <p>When the quote is signed by the customer, a dedicated project is created with all the services listed in the quotation as a task.</p>
        <p>In Planning, the surveyor can allocate the task to each employee (himself, topographer or drawer).</p>
        <p>
            In all cases, a surveyor will deliver documents. Therefore an integration with Documents is enabled to easily share the created documents and gather them if needed. To this intent a share link (share  &amp; upload) can be generated for
            each project sub-workspace so that the customer has direct access to it.
        </p>
        <p>Once the final documents are delivered to the customer, the surveyor can send the final invoice potentially adapting the hours spent on each service.<br /></p>
