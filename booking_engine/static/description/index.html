<h1>Booking Engine Module</h1>
<div class="o-paragraph">The Booking Engine Module is not part of Odoo standard but uses Odoo Studio and leverages lines
    of python code; therefore installing this module may increase your subscription.</div>
<div class="o-paragraph"><br></div>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Booking Engine Module aims at enabling the management of stay offers.</p>
<p>It enables:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <strong>definition of stay offers</strong> and supporting roles and resources;</li>
    <li>The <strong>management of bookings</strong> from a dedicated app;</li>
    <li>The <strong>guest management </strong>in terms of identity and stay offer unit;</li>
    <li>The <strong>management of city taxes</strong> due to local authorities.</li>
</ul>
<div class="o-paragraph"><br></div>
<h2>Stay Offer definition</h2>
<p>The data model of the booking engine relies on standard models from Odoo Planning.<br>However, their
    relationships are tight in this configuration and deserve explanations.</p>
<h4>Stay Offers</h4>
<p>Stay Offers correspond to Products and have specific behavior due to their Is Stay Offer setting.<br>This additional
    setting allows to filter only the Stay Offers in the Accommodation App and supports some logic.</p>
<p>In order to book Resources when renting the corresponding Stay Offer, those Products plan Services with specific
    Roles, which is hidden to user to simplify the setup.<br>On Stay Offer creation, a Role is created with the same
    name and binded to the Stay Offer.</p>
<p>Additional specific configuration is that they may have Variants relying on different Attributes.<br>For each
    combination of Variant Creation set as Instantly, defined in their Attributes &amp; Variants tab, they shall be
    associated a period and price in the Rental Prices tab.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Resources associated to the Stay Offer can be linked from the Resources tab.</p>
<h4>Rental Periods</h4>
<p>Rental Periods are available from the Rental App Configuration menu and define the unit of time for rental offers.

    <div class="o_editor_banner_content o-contenteditable-true w-100 px-3" contenteditable="true">
        <p>Rental Periods defined with Nights as Unit enable to define Check-in and Check-out time of the day,
            which will be used to set the booking start and end time.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h4>Roles</h4>
<p>Roles make the bridge between the Product, the Stay Offers, and the Resources (rooms, houses, etc.)</p>
<p>Key aspect of the Booking Engine configuration is the Sync Shift and Rental Orders setting of the Roles.<br>It
    prevents double booking of Resources by preventing overlapping shifts for Resources associated with the
    Role.<br>This reflects both in the Accommodation App with the impossibility to confirm orders when booking would
    collide with existing ones as well as in the website where the calendar is computed according to resource
    availabilities.</p>
<div class="o_editor_banner user-select-none o-contenteditable-false lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-warning pb-0 pt-3"
    data-oe-role="status" contenteditable="false" role="status">

        aria-label="Banner Warning">⚠️</i>
    <div class="o_editor_banner_content o-contenteditable-true w-100 px-3" contenteditable="true">
        <p>The roles are hidden to users in the setup of Stay Offers with Resources.<br>They are available from the
            <strong>Planning App</strong>.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<h4>Resources</h4>
<p>Resources correspond to the Stay Offer units customer actually rent, such as rooms, houses, pitches, bungalows...</p>
<p>The Stay Offers fields allows to edit the binding of Resources to Stay Offers.<br>Updating this binding in
    practice updates the binding of Role and Resources, seamlessly for users.</p>
<p>A key aspect of the Booking Engine configuration is the Working Time of Resources which is set to Rental 24/7. 
</p>
<p>A custom field Occupant is provided to capture at first sight the currently renting customer in different views.</p>
<div class="o_editor_banner user-select-none o-contenteditable-false lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3"

    <div class="o_editor_banner_content o-contenteditable-true w-100 px-3" contenteditable="true">
        <div class="o-paragraph">Note that Resources can be associated to multiple Roles even though they have a
            default one. </div>
    </div>
</div>
<h4>Attributes</h4>
<p>The Attributes associated to Variants enable to define Stay Offer variations, either as informative content, or
    impacting the Stay Offer pricing.</p>
<p>The Display Type of Attributes specifies how customers would select between two values from the e-Commerce
    website. </p>
<h6> Variant Creation set as Never</h6>
<p>This refers to informative only characteristics such as Free Wifi Included or Smoking Prohibited which can be
    displayed on the stay offer pages.</p>
<h6>Variant Creation set as Instantly</h6>
<p>In such case, the value combination of attributes lead to as many Stay Offer variations.<br>Examples for such
    Attribute are Number of Guests, Breakfast Included or not...</p>
<p>Each combination might lead to different rental price, to be defined from the Rental Prices tab of Stay
    Offers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Accommodation App</h2>
<p>The Accommodation App, labelled per the industry name, provides access to the core of the booking engine and enables
    the booking management. </p>
<h4>Booking Schedule</h4>
<p>In this app users land on the booking Schedule where they access the Gantt view of their stay offer bookings for all
    their stay offer resources.<br>This view provides load per resource and day, and provides different interactive
    capabilities.</p>
<h6>Searching a booking</h6>
<p>User can use the search bar to quickly shortlist the customer bookings.</p>
<p>The list view is a good alternative when no bookings are setup during the currently display period.</p>
<h6>Opening an Order</h6>
<p>Clicking on a Shift opens a popup from which the Rental Order number is clickable to reach it.</p>
<h6>Creating a new booking</h6>
<p>User can drag and drop over a resource line a given period, which opens a modal to save a shift for this
    resource.<br>Clicking the New Order button will bring users to the order form where they can select a customer,
    cross check order details and confirm the booking.</p>
<h6>Adding a stay offer booking to the last order</h6>
<p>User can drag and drop over a resource line a given period, which opens a modal to save a shift for this
    resource.<br>Clicking the Add to Last Order button adds a line or updates the quantity of the corresponding stay
    offer
    to the last order.</p>
<div data-oe-role="status"
    class="o_editor_banner user-select-none o-contenteditable-false lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3"
    contenteditable="false" role="status">
    <i data-oe-aria-label="Banner Info" class="o_editor_banner_icon mb-3 fst-normal" aria-label="Banner Info">💡</i>
    <div class="o_editor_banner_content o-contenteditable-true w-100 px-3" contenteditable="true">
        <p>The last order is considered as last created order by user.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h6>Changing Resource and Upgrading Offer</h6>
<p>User can drag and drop an existing Shift to another Resource, including to a Resource of another Stay Offer /
    Role.<br>In the second case, this can be used for upgrades from a standard room to a deluxe room for example.</p>
<h6>Changing Shift and Order dates</h6>
<p>User can drag and drop an existing Shift from left to right to change the Shift and associated Order dates.</p>
<div data-oe-role="status"
    class="o_editor_banner user-select-none o-contenteditable-false lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-warning pb-0 pt-3"
    contenteditable="false" role="status">
    <i data-oe-aria-label="Banner Warning" class="o_editor_banner_icon mb-3 fst-normal"
        aria-label="Banner Warning">⚠️</i>
    <div class="o_editor_banner_content o-contenteditable-true w-100 px-3" contenteditable="true">
        <p>Given such change acts on the Order dates, this as well waterfall on the different rented Products and their
            Shifts.<br>This means that all Shifts associated to this Order will change dates. </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="o-paragraph" data-selection-placeholder="" style="margin: -9px 0px 8px;"><br></div>
<div data-oe-role="status"
    class="o_editor_banner user-select-none o-contenteditable-false lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3"
    contenteditable="false" role="status">
    <i data-oe-aria-label="Banner Info" class="o_editor_banner_icon mb-3 fst-normal" aria-label="Banner Info">💡</i>
    <div class="o_editor_banner_content o-contenteditable-true w-100 px-3" contenteditable="true">
        <p> The Sync Shifts and Rental Orders setting prevents this to happen in case the change collides with any
            other Shift. </p>
    </div>
</div>
<h6>Blocking a Resource</h6>
<p>It may happen that a Resource is not available to rent in case of maintenance for instance. <br>In such cases,
    user can create a Shift on the corresponding resource line without creating a new Order or adding to the last
    Order.<br>Notes in such case might be valuable to make sure all employees are aligned about the purpose of the
    Shift.</p>
<h4>Orders</h4>
<p>The Orders menu provides a Kanban view of all rental Orders for Stay Offers.</p>
<p>They are grouped by Stage and at first focusing on today's order for check in and check out, while different filters
    allow users to efficiently search among them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Guests</h2>
<p>Guest management is handled in the module in two ways.</p>
<h4>Guest identity</h4>
<p>During check in, some countries require guest identity to be captured.</p>
<p>To support users with this duty, from the Order Guests tab, Contacts can be related to the order.<br>Opening a
    contact form allows to input guest identity details, which is reflected in the order.</p>
<p>Similarly to Orders listing Guests, Guest stays are listed from their contact form with a smart button at the top of
    the screen.</p>
<h4>Ongoing rental</h4>
<p>On top of their stays, as soon as a guest is checked in a room, the corresponding contact form displays the Resources
    checked in.<br>This enables to know at anytime where a guest is staying.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Accommodation App provides the current guest occupant from the Resources.</p>
<div class="o-paragraph"><br></div>
<h2>City Tax Management</h2>
<p>The City Tax are managed through a dedicated product, added to the Order as soon as the customer checks in.</p>
<p>At the end of the stay, at check out from the Order, a dedicated popup helps user to compute the amount of City
    Tax units due.<br>It summaries the bookings of the Order and their nights as well as an estimate of guest number
    based on the listed Guests in the Guests tab.</p>
<p>All fields are editable to compute the number of City Tax units to apply, which updates the City Tax product
    delivered quantity
    on save.</p>
