<h1>Odoo for Property Owner Associations</h1>
<p>
    This Odoo industry package is the ultimate tool for professional property managers and syndics. It is designed to
    handle the complex legal and financial structure of managing multiple condominiums simultaneously. The solution uses
    a multi-company architecture to ensure that every building’s funds and accounting are kept strictly separate. By
    automating fund calls and expense distribution based on ownership keys, it empowers you to manage more buildings
    with less administrative effort.
