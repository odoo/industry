        <h2>Easily convert the condominiums üñãÔ∏è</h2>
        <p>
            As soon as a condominium reaches out to you to get a quote, quickly send them an overview of your services and fees by creating Quotations in the <strong>Sales App</strong> where you can directly use the "Kick-Off Quote"
            quotation template. This will automatically fill the quote by adding the kick-off fees and also the price of all the extra services such as the recurring contribution, the hourly rate, etc. Don't forget to attach the terms &amp;
            conditions as well. Of course, the price of each service and the content of the Quotation Templates can be adapted accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>When the quote is confirmed for a new condominium, you can convert the prospect contact into a condominium in a click from the contact form, in the <strong>Contact App</strong>. </p>

        <h2>Never forget a task üìë</h2>
        <p>Once the quotation is confirmed, it automatically creates Projects including several tasks to properly start the collaboration. This is based on the Kick-Off Template Template project:</p>

        <h2 class="null">Set up a condominium üöÄ</h2>
        <p>Once the quotation is confirmed, the condominium should be created in Odoo. Basically, a<strong> </strong>condominium is like a company that is funded by the owners and that has to pay for operating costs.</p>
        <p>
            From the Settings, create a new company in <font style="font-weight: bolder;" class="text-o-color-1">Companies</font>. Once done, it will appear on the top right of all screens with the aim to quickly switch between your company and the
            different condominiums.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
            Once done, it is time to create the composition of the condominium by selecting the right one on the top right of the screen. 
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;"><br /></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
            Open the <strong><font class="text-o-color-1">Condominium</font></strong> App where you can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>See the information of the condominium and fill the vendors to build an address book.</li>
            <li>Create the buildings that compounds the</li>
            <li>Create the properties that compounds the buildings: apartment, studio, flat, penthouse, garage, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each property is characterized by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A name to identify the property, for example the post box or the identification code.</li>
            <li>The building to which the property belongs.</li>
            <li>The type to easily classify it.</li>
            <li>The owner history.</li>
            <li>The tenant history if relevant.</li>
            <li>Some tags to add extra visual information.</li>
            <li>The parent property, for example to indicate that a garage is linked with an apartment.</li>
            <li>The floor.</li>
            <li>
                The area.
            </li>
            <li>The meter readings history, leveraged to split bills based on consumption.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Finally, you can also define the distribution keys. The goal is to assign a ratio for each property that will be used for splitting the fees per owner and for distributing the costs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Distribution keys based on shares can be populated with all properties from the condominium and the ratios computed based on properties' surface. You can still edit the ratios as you need and includes only a sub selection of the
                properties when relevant.
            </li>
            <li>Distribution keys based on meter readings only refer to a meter. When used to split costs, the recorded meter readings for the corresponding period will be used. </li>
        </ul>

                <p>
                    A distribution key is needed for several actions.<br />
                    Defining a distribution key is efficient by populating defined properties in a click.

        <h2>Fairly split the costs ‚öñÔ∏è</h2>
        <p>Each owner has to pay recurring fees:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The working fund that is used to pay the common charges such as monthly expenses (water, electricity, gas, etc.), insurances, maintenance, repairs, cleaning of common areas, etc.</li>
            <li>The reserve fund that is a savings account used in case of exceptional expenses such as a severe repair, an investment in equipment, etc.</li>
            <li>The services provided by the condominium management company.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On the one hand, the funds requests are sent by the condominium to the owners. On the other hand, the service fees can be invoiced by "My Condominium Management" to the owners. </p>
        <h5>Requesting funds</h5>
        <p>Here are the steps to follow:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the right company from which the fees will be invoiced (see <em>Set up a condominium üöÄ</em> section to see how to switch the company).</li>
            <li>In the <strong>Sales App</strong>, create a quotation and set the condominium as customer.</li>
            <li>Set the right distribution key.</li>
            <li>In case of recurring fees:</li>
            <li class="oe-nested">
                <ol>
                    <li>Define a recurring plan, monthly or yearly.</li>
                    <li>Set the recurring plan start date.</li>
                    <li>Make sure that the products added are recurring.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Add the corresponding product(s): "Working Fund", "Reserve Fund", "Service Fees", etc.</li>
            <li>Set the right (recurring) price.</li>
            <li>
                Click on "Split by Property" button: this will cancel the current quotation and will create as many quotations as there are ongoing owners in the condominium for which the costs are shared, with a line by property they
                own.
            </li>
            <li>Click on the "Sales Orders" buttons to access all the generated quotations.</li>
            <li>Check if everything is correct. If yes, select all the quotations and, under the "Actions" button, click on "Confirm".</li>
            <li>In case of recurring fees, the invoices will be automatically generated by Odoo at the right date. If not, you can manually post them in mass. Then just send them using your preferred way!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            For example, to collect the cotisations, the selected company must be the condominium and the customer must be the condominium too. If you want to invoice your services, the selected company must be yours and the customer must be the
            condominium to be invoiced.

        <h5>Distributing costs</h5>
        <p>Record invoices from from supplier from <strong>Accounting App</strong>, by assigning supplier and listing products.</p>
        <p>Then, on a regular basis or at invoice confirmation, distribute the costs of each expenses:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the<strong> Condominium App</strong> and reach the Distributions from the Purchase menu.</li>
            <li>Assign the appropriate distribution key and if relevant the distribution period..</li>

        <p>The cost distribution inputs are available on each invoice in the distribution tab.</p>

        <p>Examples</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To distribute costs related to an annual services, such as condominium insurance fees, the distribution based on shares over a period is relevant to expense each owner in proportion of their ownership and share.</li>
            <li>To distribute costs which only impact current owners, a distribution key based on shares without period inputs is required.</li>
            <li>
                Finally, for condominiums organised with a general meter for the condominium to be expenses and then with meters for each owners to split the expenses, the distribution key based on meter is relevant and requires period inputs and
                associated meter readings for each property to be representative.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="o_editor_banner user-select-none o-contenteditable-false lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3" data-oe-role="status">

                <p>
                    Distribution keys based on meter reading require the period start and end inputs.<br />
                    When distributing costs, for each property, the closest meter readings to period boundaries are used to compute the consumption over the period, and in case of owner change, the consumption by owner is captured if a meter
                    reading is near the owner change date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Distribution keys based on shares directly use the ratios.<br />
                    Without period inputs, the distribution is handled between the current owners.<br />
                    With period inputs, the distribution is computed between owners over the corresponding period, in proportion to the ownership.

        <h2>Book the right numbers üßÆ</h2>
        <p>A condominium works like a company. It gets revenues from the owners. These are collected in two bank accounts that can be directly integrated with the bank:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Working Fund: to collect all the money that will be used to pay the recurring fees.</li>
            <li>Reserve Fund: to collect all the money that will be used in case of exceptional expense.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These will be used to pay the <strong><font class="text-o-color-1">Vendor Bills</font></strong> that can be uploaded and automatically filled thanks to <a href="https://www.odoo.com/app/invoice-automation">Artificial Intelligence</a>.
            As soon as a bill is booked, you can use the button "Distribute Cost" to automatically reflect the cost per property according to the distribution key.
