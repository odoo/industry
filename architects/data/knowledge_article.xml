                    is created when there's a new opportunity, a to-do action is generated when the opportunity is at the "needs
                    analysis stage", a reminder and activity to cancel opportunity are created when the quotation is sent)

                    Use the documents app to store and share all project documents. Sub-workspaces get created for each project,
                    and link to these sub-workspace can be shared with customers so that they have a direct access to all

                    Set a cost on each employee and use the Expense application to record project expenses. It's not just
                    about labor and materials, but also about tracking the costs of those undercover subcontractors and any
                    other project-related expenses. Open up the profitability report for your project, and there you'll see
                    budgeted costs, actual costs, revenues, and profit margins. This will help you to figure out how to boost
                    your profit.
