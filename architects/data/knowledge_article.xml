                <h2>Manage leads</h2>
                <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Leads get created in the CRM by filling the "Contact us" form of the website or manually by the salesperson.</span></p>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-size: 14px;">
                        Automated actions have been created to create activities at appropriated&nbsp;times (an action to call the lead is created when there's a new opportunity, a to-do action is generated when the opportunity is at the "needs analysis
                        stage", a reminder and activity to cancel opportunity are created when the quotation is sent)

                    <span style="font-size: 14px;">
                        From the opportunity, a quote can simply be created using the "create quote" button, and using one of the pre-created quotation template (services and quantities can be suited to the client's request)
                    </span>

                <h2>Manage projects&nbsp;</h2>
                <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Thanks to the services configuration, a project gets created automatically once the quote is confirmed by the customer. A set of tasks are created in this project, based on the sale order lines.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">There is also a map view for the projects (projects are assigned a partner based on the projects location, either with the address or with the geolocation if there's no assigned address yet)</span></p>

                        Use the documents app to store and share all project documents. Sub-workspaces get created for each project, <span style="width: 40px;" class="oe-tabs"> </span>​and link to these sub-workspace can be shared with customers so that
                        they have a direct access to all produced <span style="width: 40px;" class="oe-tabs"> </span>​documents.

                        Set a cost on each employee and use the Expense application to record project expenses. It's not just about labor and materials, but also about tracking the costs of those
                        undercover subcontractors and any other project-related expenses. Open up the profitability report for your project, and there you'll see budgeted costs, actual
                        costs, revenues, and profit margins. This will help you to figure out how to boost your profit.&nbsp;
