        <h1>Business flows</h1>
        <h2>Manage leads</h2>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Leads get created in the CRM by filling the "Contact us" form of the website or manually by the salesperson.</span></p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size: 14px;">
                Automated actions have been created to create activities at appropriated times (an action to call the lead is created when there's a new opportunity, a to-do action is generated when the opportunity is at the "needs analysis
                stage", a reminder and activity to cancel opportunity are created when the quotation is sent)
            </span>
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Create quote</h2>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size: 14px;">
                From the opportunity, a quote can simply be created using the "create quote" button, and using one of the pre-created quotation template (services and quantities can be suited to the client's request)
            </span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">A set of architectural services have already been created and can be edited to match the architects' services.</span></p>
        <br />
        <h2>Manage projects</h2>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size: 14px;">Thanks to the services configuration, a project gets created automatically once the quote is confirmed by the customer. A set of tasks are created in this project, based on the sale order lines.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">There is also a map view for the projects (projects are assigned a partner based on the projects location, either with the address or with the geolocation if there's no assigned address yet)</span></p>
        <br />
        <h3><span style="width: 40px;" class="oe-tabs"> </span>‚ÄãManage documents</h3>
        <p>
            <span style="width: 40px;" class="oe-tabs"> </span>‚Äã
            <span style="font-size: 14px;">
                Use the documents app to store and share all project documents. Sub-workspaces get created for each project, <span style="width: 40px;" class="oe-tabs"> </span>‚Äãand link to these sub-workspace can be shared with customers so
                that they have a direct access to all produced <span style="width: 40px;" class="oe-tabs"> </span>‚Äãdocuments.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="width: 40px;" class="oe-tabs"> </span>‚Äã<br /></p>
        <h3><span style="width: 40px;" class="oe-tabs"> </span>‚ÄãFollow project profitability</h3>

            <span style="font-size: 14px;">
                Set a cost on each employee and use the Expense application to record project expenses. It's not just about labor and materials, but also about tracking the costs of those undercover subcontractors and any other project-related
                expenses. Open up the profitability report for your project, and there you'll see budgeted costs, actual costs, revenues, and profit margins. This will help you to figure out how to boost your profit.
