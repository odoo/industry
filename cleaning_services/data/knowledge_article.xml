        <h2><strong>CRM for Opportunity Management</strong></h2>
        <p>The CRM module helps you capture and track customer inquiries, manage communications through chatter, and schedule follow-up tasks. This enables you to build and nurture strong customer relationships right from the first contact.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chatter</strong>: Use the chatter to communicate with team members, log notes, and keep a record of all updates related to the opportunity. Tag colleagues by typing @ followed by their name to send notifications.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Activities</strong>: Schedule activities directly within the CRM to ensure timely follow-ups. Activities are actions users take on a document, like making a call or organizing a meeting. Pending activities are visible above
                the message history in the chatter widget.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Quotationsüí≤</strong></h2>
        <p>At any time, you can create from an opportunity a beautiful and tailor-made quotation that displays the price, the discount, the unit of measure, and the tax of each:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Material that will be used to complete the task.</li>
            <li>Service such as labor hours, traveling costs, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of course, feel free to create all the products you use often. This will save you time when preparing when preparing your next quotations.</p>
        <p>Save time by directly sending the quotation by email to your customer. The personalized email provides:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The quotation in PDF format.</li>
            <li>A link to reach the online quotation from where the customer can confirm and sign it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If the customer replies to the email, the answer is automatically logged in the chatter on the right of the screen. Thereby, all the discussions regarding the quotation, its updates, and its fine tuning are attached, and the history can
            be easily consulted by all the involved users.
        </p>
        <p>Once confirmed, the quotation becomes a sales order. All quotations and sales orders are centralized in the <strong>Sales </strong>app.</p>
