                <h2>Provide accurate online quotations 📝</h2>
                <p>
                Display the different combinations of bikes on your <strong><font class="text-o-color-1">eCommerce</font></strong>, such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Color</li>
                <li>Motor</li>
                <li>Size</li>
                <li>Accessories</li>
                <li>Extra services such as assistance, warranty extension, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                Use the variants and the optional products features to make sure that your customer will find the most suitable bike. Moreover, the customer can choose the recurring plan, i.e. Monthly, Quarterly or Yearly. The corresponding prices must
                be defined in the three predefined "selectable" pricelists.
                </p>
                <p>
                Thereby, the customer can configure its bike then get an accurate quote. On your side, this quote is created in the <strong><font class="text-o-color-1">Sales</font></strong> app where you can discuss with the customer using the
                chatter. It is really useful to define the terms of the renting contract such as the delivery date, the rent duration, etc.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                Of course, you can also create a beautiful and tailor-made quotation in the <strong><font class="text-o-color-1">Sales</font></strong> app by setting the following fields:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Customer</li>
                <li>Pricelist / Recurring</li>
                <li>Until</li>
                <li>Products</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This can be sent by email to your customer who will be able to confirm it with a signature.</p>

                <h2>Deliver the order in time 🚚</h2>
                <p>
                As soon as the quotation is confirmed, a delivery is automatically created in the <strong><font class="text-o-color-1">Inventory</font></strong> app. This is essential to track which bike is rent. During the delivery process, you will
                have to fill the serial number of the bike.
                </p>
                <p>Moreover, an activity is automatically created to remind you the return of the product. This is planned at the same date as the deadline of the rental contract.</p>

                <h2>Send effortless recurring invoices 🔁</h2>
                <p>Thanks to the auto-post feature, the recurring invoices will be automatically generated from the sales order. So, you just need to send them to the customer according to your preferred method: email, snail mail, e-invoicing, etc.</p>
                <h2>Purchase to face the demand 🚲</h2>
                <p>
                If the stock levels are too low, resupply the materials from the
                <strong>
                        <font class="text-o-color-1">Purchase</font>
                </strong>
                app by creating a purchase order linked to the right vendor. In the
                <strong>
                        <font class="text-o-color-1">Contact</font>
                </strong>
                app, you can easily manage all your preferred vendors and don't hesitate to set a warning to remind if there is a minimum amount to get free transport costs.
                </p>
