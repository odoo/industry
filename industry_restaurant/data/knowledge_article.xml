                    <p>If bundling tables for larger groups is a common practice at your place, you can setup such configuration by defining which tables can be added to one by opening a tabe and assigning linled resources: Appointments App &gt; Configuration &gt; Resources &gt; Select the table to link others to.</p>

Go to the <strong>Website App</strong> to discover a sample website and explore millions of possibilities by clicking on the "Edit" button.</p><div class="o_editor_banner user-select-none o-contenteditable-false lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3" data-oe-role="status">

Replenishment</h3><hr/><p>Replenishment is essential but challenging for a bar owner to systematize.</p><p>You have two main possibilities in Odoo to ease your replenishment process.</p><p><strong>1. Flow 1:</strong> Most products need a human assessment as the remaining quantity cannot be automatically computed. For those, a Recurring Task is created in the <strong>Project App</strong>. This task reappears every week, and you can personalize it with a checklist to avoid forgetting anything. </p><p>Go to your <strong>Purchase App</strong> to easily create Requests for Proposal or Purchase Orders.</p><div class="alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3 d-flex align-items-center">
    <i class="mb-3 fst-normal">üí°</i>
    <div class="px-3">
        <p>By the way, you can see another project with recurring tasks. This one is a demo for cleaning tasks.</p>
    </div>
</div><p><strong>2. Flow 2:</strong> For products that can be tracked, such as bottled beers and sodas, you can use automated purchases. To try it, navigate to your Point of Sale and sell a Blond Beer to a customer. </p><div class="alert alert-warning pb-0 pt-3 d-flex align-items-center">
    <i class="mb-3 fst-normal">‚ö†Ô∏è</i>
    <div class="px-3">
        <p>The stock is only updated when you close your register. Let's do it before continuing to the next step.</p>
    </div>
</div><p>By doing so, you have only 23 beers left in your stock.</p><div class="alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3 d-flex align-items-center">
    <i class="mb-3 fst-normal">üîÅ</i>
    <div class="px-3">
        <p>You can see that there is a reordering rule configured for this product if you go to Inventory &gt; Products &gt; Blond Beer</p>
        <p>Reordering rules are displayed in the smart buttons on top of your product. You can see a minimum quantity, and a maximum. Each time the forecast stock lowers beneath the minimum stock, it automatically creates a purchase order to replenish to the maximum quantity. </p>
    </div>
</div><div class="o_editor_banner user-select-none o-contenteditable-false lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-success pb-0 pt-3" data-oe-role="status">
                <i class="o_editor_banner_icon mb-3 fst-normal" data-oe-aria-label="Banner Success">‚úÖ</i>
                <div class="o_editor_banner_content o-contenteditable-true w-100 px-3"><p>You can access all products and their reordering rules from the Inventory &gt; Operations &gt; Replenishment</p></div>
            </div><p>If you navigate to your <strong>Purchase App</strong>, you can see a new Purchase Order that is ready to be sent. You can choose a packaging if your product has an existing one.</p><p>You can now email your Request for Proposal to your vendor or confirm it manually. </p><p>Once the products are there, you can click the "Receipt" smart button to validate your receipt and add these new products to your stock.</p><p><a href="https://www.odoo.com/documentation/latest/applications/inventory_and_mrp/inventory.html" class="btn btn-fill-primary">üéì Inventory</a></p><p> <br/></p><h3>5. Plan your services</h3><hr/><p>Plan your services easily using the <strong>Planning App</strong>. </p><p>1. First, create all your employees in the database. Navigate to the <strong>Employees App </strong>to do so. </p><p>2. Create your employees' roles under the "Work Information" tab. Some are already created for this demo.</p><div class="alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3 d-flex align-items-center">
    <i class="mb-3 fst-normal">üöÄ</i>
    <div class="px-3">
        <p>If you want to assign them an Odoo user account, you can select a related user in the "hr/ Settings" tab.</p>
    </div>
</div><p>3. Return to the Planning App. You can see a few shifts ready to be planned. Select the down arrow next to the publish button and click "Auto Plan." Your shifts will be automatically assigned based on your employees' availability.</p><p>4. You can still reassign any shift to adapt the planning.</p><p>5. Once you are happy with it, send it to your co-workers by smashing the publish button.</p><p><br/></p><p>Make your team grow&#160;smoothly leveraging this package!</p><p>1. From the <strong>Employees App</strong>, create&#160;new employees, making sure to assign roles in the Work Information tab to auto plan their shifts, and their Hourly Cost in the Settings tab for your profitability computations.</p><div class="o_editor_banner user-select-none o-contenteditable-false lh-1 d-flex align-items-center alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3" data-oe-role="status">

                    <p>If you want each employee to have their own access as users, you will need to create&#160;users for them and associate them to the newly created employees from the Settings tab.</p>
                </div>
            </div><p>2. From the<strong> Point of Sales App </strong>&gt; Configuration &gt; Settings, assign the appropriate rights to those new employees in the POS interface section.</p><p><a class="btn btn-fill-primary" href="https://www.odoo.com/documentation/latest/applications/services/planning.html">üéì Planning</a></p><p><br/></p><p>Willing your employees to clock in and out?

                    <p>You can secure the clocking in and out using the employee's PIN&#160;code.
