<p> <br/></p>
<h3>1. Point of sale</h3>
 <hr/>
<p>From the Point of Sale, open your register on the main dashboard. </p>
<p>1. You are ready to welcome your first customers. To do so, select a table on the floor map and select the products they asked for from the list. </p>

<div class="alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3 d-flex align-items-center">
    <i class="mb-3 fst-normal">üí°</i>
    <div class="px-3">
        <p>You can easily edit the floor map by clicking "Edit plan" in the top-right menu when on the table selection step of your Point of Sale.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>2. To make it more interesting, feel free to create a second order. For this one, select the "Burger Menu Combo" product. You can choose 2 burger options and 4 different drinks. This "Combo" feature will allow you to create a menu with several courses and choices for each.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning pb-0 pt-3 d-flex align-items-center">
    <i class="mb-3 fst-normal">‚ö†Ô∏è</i>
    <div class="px-3">
        <p>Don't forget to hit the "Order" button each time you change an order. This will forward the order to the Kitchen Display.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>3. After placing your orders, look at our Kitchen Display. Click the "Backend" menu in the right corner to return to your backend, then switch to the Kitchen Display App. </p>
<p>4. Open your preparation screen. Your orders are there. You can now mark them as done either line by line or the entire order by clicking on the top.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3 d-flex align-items-center">
    <i class="mb-3 fst-normal">üöÄ</i>
    <div class="px-3">
        <p>You currently have two steps in your Kitchen Display: one for the kitchen/bar and one for the service. You can configure steps in the kitchen display configuration menu.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>At the end of your service, remember to close your register. To do so, in the Point of Sale App, select "Close Register" in the top-right menu. You can then precise your cash amount and validate the closing.</p>
<p> <br/></p>
<h3>2. Table booking</h3>
 <hr/>
<p>Manage your booking using the Appointment App. </p>
<p>You can discover a pre-configured Appointment Type named "Book a table". Use it to schedule services, the duration of each booking, and every communication you want to send to your customers when they place a booking. </p>

<div class="alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3 d-flex align-items-center">
    <i class="mb-3 fst-normal">üí°</i>
    <div class="px-3">
        <p>This setup is made to provide availability from Monday to Friday, with 2 services a day (12:00 AM to 15:00 PM and 18:00 PM to 23:00 PM).</p>
        <p>Setting different starts for the same service allows you to give your customer the possibility to book every 15 minutes in this setup. </p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Do you want to test it and see how it looks on your website? Click on the "Preview" button. </p>
<p>Share a direct link with external services using the "Share" option.</p>
<p> <br/></p>
<h3>3. Website and online menu</h3>
 <hr/>
<p>Your website management has never been so easy. Go to the "Website App" to discover a sample website and explore millions of possibilities by clicking on the "Edit" button.</p>
<p><a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://www.odoo.com/documentation/17.0/applications/websites/website.html">üéì Website</a></p>
<p> <br/></p>
<h3>4. Replenishment</h3>
 <hr/>
<p>Replenishment is essential but challenging for a bar owner to systematize.</p>
<p>You have two main possibilities in Odoo to ease your replenishment process.</p>
<p><strong>1. Flow 1:</strong> Most products need a human assessment as the remaining quantity cannot be automatically computed. For those, a Recurring Task is created in the Project App. This task reappears every week, and you can personalize it with a checklist to avoid forgetting anything. </p>
<p>Go to your Purchase App to easily create Requests for Proposal or Purchase Orders.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3 d-flex align-items-center">
    <i class="mb-3 fst-normal">üí°</i>
    <div class="px-3">
        <p>By the way, you can see another project with recurring tasks. This one is a demo for cleaning tasks.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p><strong>2. Flow 2:</strong> For products that can be tracked, such as bottled beers and sodas, you can use automated purchases. To try it, navigate to your Point of Sale and sell a Blond Beer to a customer. </p>

<div class="alert alert-warning pb-0 pt-3 d-flex align-items-center">
    <i class="mb-3 fst-normal">‚ö†Ô∏è</i>
    <div class="px-3">
        <p>The stock is only updated when you close your register. Let's do it before continuing to the next step.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>By doing so, you have only 23 beers left in your stock.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3 d-flex align-items-center">
    <i class="mb-3 fst-normal">üîÅ</i>
    <div class="px-3">
        <p>You can see that there is a reordering rule configured for this product if you go to Inventory &gt; Products &gt; Blond Beer</p>
        <p>Reordering rules are displayed in the smart buttons on top of your product. You can see a minimum quantity, and a maximum. Each time the forecast stock lowers beneath the minimum stock, it automatically creates a purchase order to replenish to the maximum quantity. </p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>If you navigate to your Purchase App, you can see a new Purchase Order that is ready to be sent. You can choose a packaging if your product has an existing one.</p>
<p>You can now email your Request for Proposal to your vendor or confirm it manually. </p>
<p>Once the products are there, you can click the "Receipt" smart button to validate your receipt and add these new products to your stock. </p>
<p> <br/></p>
<h3>5. Plan your services</h3>
 <hr/>
<p>Plan your services easily using the Planning App. </p>
<p>1. First, create all your employees in the database. Navigate to the Employee App to do so. </p>
<p>2. Create your employees' roles under the "Work Information" tab. Some are already created for this demo.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info pb-0 pt-3 d-flex align-items-center">
    <i class="mb-3 fst-normal">üöÄ</i>
    <div class="px-3">
        <p>If you want to assign them an Odoo user account, you can select a related user in the "HR Settings" tab.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>3. Return to the Planning App. You can see a few shifts ready to be planned. Select the down arrow next to the publish button and click "Auto Plan." Your shifts will be automatically assigned based on your employees' availability.</p>
<p>4. You can still reassign any shift to adapt the planning.</p>
<p>5. Once you are happy with it, send it to your co-workers by smashing the publish button.</p>
<p> <br/></p>

<div class="alert alert-success pb-0 pt-3 d-flex align-items-center">
    <i class="mb-3 fst-normal">üéâ</i>
    <div class="ms-3">
