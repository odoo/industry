                </p>
                <p>This setup is for hair salons providing hair-related services such as hair cutting, brushing, coloring,
                    hair and scalp treatments, beard and mustache shaping.
                </p>
                <p>A typical flow involves a client visiting the hair salon’s website to book an appointment. He selects
                    from a variety of services:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a simple brushing (30 minutes)</li>
                    <li>an haircut &amp; a brushing (1 hour)</li>
                    <li>a color, an haircut &amp; a brushing (3 hours)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>&nbsp;He then selects his preferred hairdresser according to the availability.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>During the service execution and depending on the client's needs and preferences, additional services
                    such as conditioning, scalp massages, or other treatments may be offered. Those will be accounted for
                    during the payment process using Point Of Sales (POS). Once the customer is ready to check out, the
                    salon can also sell him haircare and styling products.
                </p>
                <p>The salon also offers a loyalty program to reward loyal customers.&nbsp;</p>
